## 1. Float

The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow. See the examples below :

<h3>Key word Values</h3>
<ul>
    <li>float: left</li>
    <li>float: right</li>
    <li>float: none</li>
    <li>float: inline-start</li>
    <li>float: inline-end</li>
</ul>

## 2. Flex Property


The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.
1. The FlexBox Axis
    When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes â€” the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.

<h3>The row main axis</h3>

<h3>The column main axis</h3>

<p>An Example of a simple flexbox implementation is: </p>
<br>

```css
main {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  
}
```

Loreflm Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1xxxxx500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
